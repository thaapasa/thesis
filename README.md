## Using Open-Source Solutions in Agile Software Development

Software requirements are becoming more and more complicated. Software systems
can no longer be developed feasibly without the aid of supporting libraries and tools.
For this purpose, commercial software libraries have been created to be reused across
multiple projects. Presently, open-source solutions are beginning to emerge alongside
their commercial counterparts to support virtually all areas of software development.

Additionally, customers expect custom-made systems to meet their needs in a 
constantly changing business world. Because requirement changes are on the increase,
it is no longer feasible to plan everything up front. Change must be embraced in
software development. The relatively new agile methodologies adopt change as an
integral part of the software development process.

This thesis studies how well the software libraries, frameworks and tools available
from the open source community perform in agile software development projects. A
commercial project is initiated to serve as a case study. A set of mature, mainstream
open-source solutions is selected for the project, and agile methodologies are used in
the project management. The project and the resulting software are measured and
evaluated using a set of metrics designed for evaluating both software quality and
agile methodology adoption.

On the basis of the results from the metrics and subjective evaluation of the project,
it can be concluded that mature open-source solutions and agile development methods 
can work well together, with features of the frameworks and tools supporting the
agile practices.
